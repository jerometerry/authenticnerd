      <h2>Redefining N.E.R.D.</h2>
      <p>
        I was bullied in grade school for being a nerd. As a professional, I leaned into it. 
        Now, my creative side lets me redefine what that word truly means to me:
      </p>
      <ul class="acronym-list">
        <li><strong>N</strong>eurodivergent</li>
        <li><strong>E</strong>mpathetic</li>
        <li><strong>R</strong>omantic</li>
        <li><strong>D</strong>ramatic</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="purpose">
      <h2>Why This Blog Exists</h2>
      <p>
        I write in a stream-of-consciousness style to capture bits of my subconsciousness that 
        I usually miss. Once those raw ideas are captured, I can apply critical thinking, 
        challenge my beliefs, and start <em>reprogramming myself</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sharing this journey is my way of paying it forward to everyone who has helped me along the way.
